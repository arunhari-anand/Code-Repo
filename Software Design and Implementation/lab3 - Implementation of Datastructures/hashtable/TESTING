### Testing 'hashtable'

In order to test the *hashtable* module, we built a hashtable_test program that tests all of the functionality
of the hashtable module.

It also tests for the error cases, where some of the arguments passed may be NULL (or negative numbers
where positive numbers are expected).

The program first creates a hashtable with 3 slots then inserts 4 ints into it with string keys
(thereby guaranteeing a collision). Then hashtable_find, hashtable_print,
hashtable_iterate and hashtable_delete are tested.

`hashtable_find()` was called with both items that are known to be in the hashtable and items that are known to
not be in the hashtable.

hashtable_iterate is called to add an int (5) to every item in the hashtable.

hashtable_print is used to confirm the success of all of the above operations.

### Test run

An example test run is in `hashtable_test.out`, built with

	make all; ./hashtable_test > hashtable_test.out

In that file one can see the progress of building a hashtable, the results of `hashtable_print`,
and the results of different `hashtable_iterate` and `hashtable_delete` tests.
