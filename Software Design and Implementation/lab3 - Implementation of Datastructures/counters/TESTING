### Testing 'counters'

In order to test the *set* module, we built a counters_test program that tests all of the functionality
of the counters module.

It also tests for the error cases, where some of the arguments passed may be NULL (or negative numbers
where positive numbers are expected).

The program first creates a new counters, then new counters are inserted in, with repetition of keys.

Negative keys are also tried, and also a null counters object is also passed (these have
no effect on the later print statements).

Then counters_set is tried with existing and new keys.

Then counters_get is tried with a key that is known to be in the set and a key that is known
to not be in the counters set.

Then counters_print is used to confirm the success of all the above operations.
Counters_iterate is used to return the sum of all the counts, and counters_delete is called.

NULL arguments are also passed to all the above functions to set that the module
handles this properly.



### Test run

An example test run is in `counters_test.out`, built with

	make all; ./counters_test > counters_test.out

In that file one can see the progress of building a counters, the results of `counters_print`,
and the results of different `set_iterate` and `set_delete` tests.

### Limitations
No limitations.
