### Testing 'set'

In order to test the *set* module, we built a set_test program that tests all of the functionality
of the set module.

It also tests for the error cases, where some of the arguments passed may be NULL (or negative numbers
where positive numbers are expected).

The program first creates a set and then inserts ints into it with string keys. Then set_find,
set_print, set_iterate and set_delete are tested.

`set_find()` was called with both items that are known to be in the set and items that are known to
not be in the set.

set_iterate is called to add an int (5) to every item in the set.

set_print is used to confirm the success of all of the above operations.

### Test run

An example test run is in `set_test.out`, built with

	make all; ./set_test > set_test.out

In that file one can see the progress of building a set, the results of `set_print`,
and the results of different `set_iterate` and `set_delete` tests.
