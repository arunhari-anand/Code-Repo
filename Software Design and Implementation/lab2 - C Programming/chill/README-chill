README for chill.c
Arun Anand, Summer 2017

Compiling: mygcc -o chill chill.c

Usage:
/*
 * chill.c - output wind_chill tables by temperature and wind velocity
 *
 *
 * usage: three different ways to call:
 * (i) chill (ii) chill temp (iii) chill temp wind
 * where:
 *   temp is the temperature and wind is the windspeed
 *
 * output: in case (i) prints out a table of temperatures from -10 to 40 by tens,
 * windspeeds from 5 to 15 by fives and the corresponding windchill values
 * in case (ii) it prints out a table of windchill from 5 to 15 by fives and
 * the corresponding windchills for the given temperature
 * in case (iii) prints out a single line table of temperature, wind velocity and
 * the corresponding wind chill.
 * Requirements: temp must be between -99 and 50 exclusive, and wind must be
 * atleast 0.5 MPH
 *
 *
 *
 * stdin: none
 * stdout: printout of the table
 * stderr: error messages

Example command lines:
  ./chill 10
  ./chill 10 15
  ./chill

Exit status:
  0 - success
  1 - too many arguments
  2 - argument(s) is/are non-numerical
  3 - temp out of range
  4 - wind is out of range

Assumptions:

-No assumptions are made on the input, so the program will not crash.
-However, (i) if there are too many arguments, (ii) if there are non-numerical
arguments or (iii) temp or wind (or both) is/are out of range then the program
will terminate execution and print an error message.

"Non"-Assumptions:

- the number of arguments is flexible and can be 0, 1, or 2.


Limitations:

-Will not be able to handle inputs outside the legal temp and
wind ranges.
-Will not be able to handle inputs for temperature and wind_chill
to calculate wind velocities
- Will not be able to handle inputs of wind velocity and wind_chill
to calculate temperature
