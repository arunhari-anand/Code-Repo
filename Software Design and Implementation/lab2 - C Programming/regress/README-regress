Usage:
/*
 * regress.sh - perform regression testing for a shell script program
 *
 * usage: regress.sh dirname tesfile
 * where:
 *   dirname is the name of the directory where the testfiles are stored
 *
 * output: prints where the test results are Saved
 *creates a directory to save all the newly run testresults
 *prints out the differences between dirname and the newly created directory
 *
 *
 *
 * stdin: none
 * stdout: printout of where the test results are saved, and a listing of differences

Example command lines:
  regress.sh dirname testfile0 testile1 testfile2

Exit status:
  0 - success
  1 - too few arguments
  2 - dirname exists, but it is not a directory
  3 - one of the files is not regular or readable
  4 - differences exist between the newly created directory and dirname
  5 - invalid directory name

Assumptions:

-No assumptions are made on the input, so the program will not crash.
-However, (i) if there are too few arguments, (ii) if dirname exists but it
isnt a directory, (iii) if one of the files is not regular or readable, then
the program will terminate execution and print and error message

"Non"-Assumptions:

- dirname need not exist: if it doesnt exist the newly created directory will be
renamed as "dirname"


Limitations:

-The script will only output the differences between the testcases that are
common to both base and the newly created directory. Thus no new testcases can
be added.
