README for histo.c
Arun Anand, Summer 2017

Compiling: mygcc -o histo histo.c

Usage:
/*
 * histo.c - outputs a histogram of the nonnegative numbers from stdin
 *
 *
 * usage: three different ways to call:
 * histo
 *
 * output: upon EOF, the program will generate and output a histogram
 * of all the numbers from stdin, using the minimum possible bin size
 * that is a power of 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * stdin: A set of numbers
 * stdout: A generated histogram with 16 bins, with bin size specified
 * stderr: error messages

Example command lines:
  ./histo

Exit status:
  0 - success


Assumptions:

- The numbers entered must fall within the range of ints, otherwise
they will be ignored
- Any negative number will be ignored
- All individual numbers must be separated by white space
- Any non-numerical, non-space entry will cause the program to terminate
and print out the histogram for the numbers entered thus far

"Non"-Assumptions:

- Numbers may be separated by space, new line, tab, etc.
- The bins will be dynamically resized so the user is not required
to provide an indication of bin size.


Limitations:

- Does not accomodate negative Numbers.
- Does not accomodate numbers outside the range of ints.
